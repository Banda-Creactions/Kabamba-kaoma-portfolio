        		<h1>About Kay</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I’m Kay, a final-year Guidance and Counseling student at the University of Zambia, passionate about creating positive change through counseling, brand representation, and health advocacy. My journey has led me to work in both personal counseling and brand engagement, helping people and organizations find value and connection in the services I offer.</p>

<h4>My Background and Experience</h4>
<p>I’m currently finishing my degree in Guidance and Counseling with Education, where I’ve gained a strong foundation in psychological principles, counseling methods, and communication strategies. My studies have provided me with tools to assist individuals in navigating various life challenges—whether they’re facing personal, academic, or career-related issues. Through these years of training, I have developed the skills and empathy needed to foster meaningful change in people’s lives.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic experience, I’ve had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world settings. My role as a Brand Interface Ambassador with EXP Zambia has allowed me to represent major brands like Coca-Cola, Engen, and Sunlight. This experience taught me how to educate consumers, promote brand value, and effectively increase product sales through authentic customer engagement. By creating strong connections between brands and their audiences, I’ve been able to contribute to the growth of well-loved products and help companies strengthen their relationships with customers.</p>

<p>During my internship with Our Lady’s Hospice, I worked as a Trainee Counselor as part of Zambia’s 95-95-95 HIV campaign. The campaign aims to ensure that 95% of Zambia’s population is aware of their HIV status, with those who are HIV positive receiving antiretroviral treatment and achieving viral suppression. This experience was both challenging and rewarding, as I had the chance to contribute to one of Zambia’s critical health goals. I supported individuals in understanding their health status and accessing needed care, which deepened my commitment to community health and wellness advocacy.</p>

<h4>Skills and Approach</h4>
<p>My approach to counseling and advocacy is rooted in my core values: empathy, integrity, respect, and confidentiality. These values guide how I interact with clients, ensuring that every individual feels valued and understood. Here are some key skills that I bring to my work:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Counseling Expertise:</strong> I am trained in psychological theories and counseling techniques, allowing me to support clients through complex situations with care and professionalism.</li>
    <li><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Strong verbal and written communication skills help me build trust and clarity with clients and consumers alike. I believe open and honest communication is crucial to achieving positive outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Empathy and Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> I have an appreciation for diverse backgrounds and perspectives, which helps me adapt my approach to meet each client’s unique needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> I enjoy working through challenges and implementing strategies that bring about real, positive change, whether in personal counseling or brand engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Engagement:</strong> My experience as a Brand Interface Ambassador taught me how to build rapport with customers, understand their needs, and represent brands effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vision and Goals</h4>
<p>My vision is to make a lasting impact by combining my skills in counseling and brand engagement with my dedication to health and wellness. Whether I’m working with clients one-on-one or representing a brand in the community, my goal is to foster genuine connections, support individual growth, and contribute to larger societal improvements. I hope to continue using my experience in both counseling and brand representation to create positive and measurable change.</p>

<h4>Get in Touch</h4>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my journey and professional experience. If you’re interested in any of the services I offer or would like to connect, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to new opportunities to collaborate and make a difference!</p>
